# Light-Stopper
Simple arduino uno based game. Stop the light on the red LED to progress to the next stage. You win when all lights glow simultaneously. 

Note: You need to hold down on the button to guarantee your press is recognized. Hold until you see the LED you stopped on flash, then let go. To choose game mode, hold down on button attached to digital input 1 for "random_light" or do nothing for "timer_light". You must hold the button before the game starts. If you can't get "random_light" to start, hit the arduino reset button and hold down the mode select button asap.
